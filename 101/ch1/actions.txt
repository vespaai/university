actions to take at the start of training:

- ensure you're able to login using a google
  or github account on https://console.vespa-cloud.com/

- You do not need to create your own "tenant"
  (the organization / billing entity in vespa cloud);
  if you contact Radu he will give you access to the
  "training1" tenant.

- we'll assume you have installed standard developer tools:
  * git
  * curl
- also recommended:
  * jq

- ensure you have the "vespa" CLI tool installed:

vespa query -v "yql=select field1 from product where true"
vespa document -v remove id:ecommerce:product::1
